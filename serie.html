			<h2>Description:</h2><br>

			<p>It is the story of a young high school student as she descends into despair brought on by betrayal and bullying, culminating with her suicide. <br> She details the thirteen reasons why she was driven to end her life in an audio diary which is mailed to a friend two weeks after her death. <br><br>
			At its core, 13 Reasons Why is a study in how we treat one another. It examines the “small” aggressions we commit that cause unthinkable pain, and the larger ones that become even more painful when we are told we must “move on” from them. It’s also an unflinching, realistic look on particularly challenging topics, including rape, suicide, and depression.</p>
