			<h4>Season 1</h4>
			<p> Each tape corresponded to a different person at school who had bullied or mistreated Hannah, and each episode revolved around one of the tapes. It was revealed Hannah was raped by Bryce Walker, as well as bullied and sexually harassed by various classmates, including Justin Foley, Tyler Down and Marcus Cole.</p>

			<h4>Season 2</h4>
			<p>13 Reasons Why season 2 debuted on May 18. The first season of the Netflix show followed a high school student named Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette) who is tasked with following a series of tapes left to his classmates by a girl named Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), after she died by suicide. The adaptation of the novel by Jay Asher and executive produced by Selena Gomez sparked a major conversation when it debuted in March 2017. While some applauded the series for putting a spotlight on various taboo subjects, it also received criticism from some viewers and mental health experts for its portrayals of suicide, sexual assault, bullying, and substance use.</p>

			<h4>Season 3</h4>
			<p>The premiere seems to point the finger at Clay first — poor kid. The cops question him at the station, but there isn’t much to stick on him — although his bike lock was found at Bryce’s home and he kinda, maybe was overheard threatening to kill the asshat the night before. The last time Bryce was seen was at the big homecoming football game between Liberty and Bryce’s new school Hillcrest, where a massive fight broke out — literally all the guys have bruises now, and Zach’s even on crutches. For some reason, Zach is also lying and not pointing the finger at Bryce, even though there’s photographic evidence of Bryce launching at his former bestie. Oddly, Tyler has a voicemail from Bryce telling him he’s dealing with something for him and that Tyler’s all good now — there are SO many layers to this mystery.</p>
